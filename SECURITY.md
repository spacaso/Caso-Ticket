# Security Policy

Thanks for checking out our project — and especially for caring about security.

If you're here because you’ve found something unusual, we really appreciate you taking the time to report it responsibly.

##  Reporting a Vulnerability

If you’ve discovered a potential security issue, please **do not share it publicly**.

Instead, contact us privately so we can investigate and resolve the issue without exposing users to risk.

###  How to Reach Us

- Open a support ticket via our Discord: [Spacaso Zone](https://discord.gg/UzH3PazSfj)

When submitting a report, please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce it (if possible)
- Any supporting evidence, logs, or screenshots

We aim to respond within **24–48 hours**, and we’ll keep you informed throughout the process.
